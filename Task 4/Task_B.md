# 1) Capacitive Sensor :-   
     
* Capacitive pressure sensors measure pressure by detecting changes in electrical capacitance caused by the movement of plates of capacitor.  
* High Sensitivity  
* **Working :-**  So we will have a top Rigid layer of plastic or some other similar surface which is rigid but not completely stiff.Below that we will place some capacitive sensors all over the surface. When the ball is on any one of those sensors it will apply pressure on top layer which will transfer the pressure to capacitive sensor which will detect it and we will get to know the position of the ball and in which direction the ball is moving by checking the previous data of other sensors.


  **Pros** :- 

* Highly sensitive allowing us to have high control over ball movements  
* Fast response time allowing for fine adjustments in real time  
* Less costly  
* Relatively easier to integrate in a system


  **Cons** :-                       

* Due to environmental sensitivity it might give some errors while determining position of ball  
* Filtering noises could result in slight delay in detecting ball movements      
* Cost may increase for additional calibration of noises  

  	

# 2) Infra Red Sensors :-   
     
* Infra Red Sensors emits the light in order to sense some object of the surroundings.  
* **Working :-** The IR Led emist light on the ball and it detects the light reflected back. The amount of light detected changes based on distance. More distance means less light and less distance means more light.  
    
    
    
 **Pros :-**   
* Good for short range detection  
* Very fast response time  
* Very low cost  
* Easy to integrate in system

  		

**Cons** :-            

* Accuracy might get affected by lights and color of ball  
* we need to use multiple sensors for high accuracy
